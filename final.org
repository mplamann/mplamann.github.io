* Project Description
In this project, I wrote a fractal renderer that draws iterated function
systems using the chaos game algorithm.

* Build Instructions
From the project directory, run
#+begin_src shell
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../src/
  make
#+end_src

Then, from the project directory, you can run the program with
#+begin_src bash
  ./build/drawfractal fractals/sierpinski.json
#+end_src

* Results
First, I implemented enough code to draw a Sierpinski triangle:
[[file:sierpinski.png]]

The data file that generated this fractal is
#+begin_src javascript
{ "transforms": [
    {"matrix": [[0.5, 0],
	      [0, 0.5]],
     "offset": [0,0]},
    {"matrix": [[0.5, 0],
	      [0, 0.5]],
     "offset": [0.5,0]},
    {"matrix": [[0.5, 0],
	      [0, 0.5]],
     "offset": [0,0.5]}
],
  "scale": 500,
  "offset": [50, 50]
}
#+end_src
The entire fractal is represented as a JSON object.
The "transforms" attribute describes a set of affine transforms
that we apply during the chaos game.
The "scale" and "offset" attributes describe the transformation that
is applied to the points to make it fit the viewing window.
