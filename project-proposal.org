** Option G: Iterated Function Systems
For this project, I plan to implement the iterated function systems
extension to assignment 1.
My goal with this project is to be able to draw fractal flame images
similar to this [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Flame_Apophysis_Fractal_Flame.jpg][sample image]].
I am not sure if this goal is ambitious enough for this project, so
I could extend it to render animated fractal flames, or possibly
to run its computations on a nvidia gpu using CUDA. I'd appreciate any
feedback on what a reasonable workload looks like for this project.
** Implementation Plan
  1) Convert my assignment 1 code to render images based on procedures 
     and command line arguments rather than SVG files.
  2) Draw a Sierpinski triangle.
  3) If I am implementing animation, now would be a great time to do it.
     Draw a Sierpinski triangle being constructed iteration-by-iteration.
  4) Draw a Barnsley Fern.
  5) I'm not sure if irradiance caching and distance functions are 
     required for this task. If so, read more about them and implement
     them.
  6) Implement the fractal flame rendering algorithm.
